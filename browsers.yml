# Define your browser blacklists here.

blacklist:

- browser:
    family: Safari
    # This is some weird syntax! YAML doesn't have a native tuple
    # type, and this is how Python represents and compares versions.
    # So to ban all Safari versions prior to 8.0, say this:
    version__lt: !!python/tuple [8]
    # If you needed to ban everything prior to 8.1, you'd say:
    # version__lt: !!python/tuple [8, 1]

- browser:
    # Match everything that introduces itself as Opera, regardless of
    # version
    family: Opera

- browser:
    # "Safari" and "Mobile Safari" are distinct.
    family: Mobile Safari
    version__lt: !!python/tuple [9]

- os:
    # You can match other things than just the browser, e.g. the OS:
    family: Windows
  browser:
    family: IE
    version__lt: !!python/tuple [11]

- browser:
    family: Chrome Mobile
    version__lt: !!python/tuple [48]
